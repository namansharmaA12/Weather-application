#DESCRIPTION



For my web development project, I designed and built a responsive weather forecast web application. This project demonstrates my ability to integrate APIs, design user-friendly interfaces, and create a fully functional application using front-end web technologies. The primary objective was to build a weather app that shows current weather, 5-day forecast, air quality index, sunrise and sunset times, and other weather highlights for any city entered by the user or based on the user’s current location.

The editor I used throughout the development of this project was Visual Studio Code (VS Code), as it provides excellent features for web development like syntax highlighting, live server extensions, and a clean interface. I started by setting up a simple HTML skeleton to structure the webpage. Then, I added CSS to style the layout, cards, buttons, and typography. The design is fully responsive, meaning it adjusts and looks good on screens of all sizes, including mobiles, tablets, and desktops. I achieved this responsiveness by writing media queries in CSS and ensuring flexible layouts using CSS Grid and Flexbox.

I made sure the app was visually appealing by using a dark theme with contrasting colors, clean typography, and icons to improve readability and user experience. Icons from Font Awesome and Boxicons were used to represent weather conditions and interface elements such as sunrise, sunset, wind, humidity, and more.

The most interesting and challenging part of the project was fetching and displaying live weather data. To achieve this, I integrated the OpenWeatherMap API, which provides a wide range of weather-related data. I utilized three specific API endpoints:

Current Weather API — to display current weather temperature, humidity, wind, etc.

Forecast API — to display a 5-day forecast as well as an hourly forecast.

Air Pollution API — to show the air quality index and pollutant details.
Additionally, I used the Geocoding API to convert city names to coordinates and vice versa.

The JavaScript code I wrote handles all the API calls, processes the returned JSON data, and updates the webpage dynamically with real-time information. The user can either type a city name or use their current geolocation to fetch the weather data. I also handled errors gracefully, showing user-friendly messages in case of failed API requests or invalid city names.

During the development, I faced some issues like CORS errors and incorrect API URLs, but I resolved them through debugging and referring to documentation and tutorials. To help me understand the API integration and resolve errors, I used resources such as YouTube tutorials for general guidance and ChatGPT to get quick help with code corrections and explanations.

I learned a lot while working on this project, especially about integrating third-party APIs, handling asynchronous JavaScript with fetch, and designing responsive layouts. I also improved my debugging skills and got more comfortable working with real-time data.

In conclusion, I’m proud of this weather app as it not only demonstrates my technical skills but also provides a useful and interactive experience for users. In future iterations, I’d like to add features like saving favorite cities, switching between Celsius and Fahrenheit, adding animations, and perhaps even a dark/light mode toggle. This project reinforced the importance of clean code, responsive design, and learning how to leverage external tools and APIs to build real-world applications.
